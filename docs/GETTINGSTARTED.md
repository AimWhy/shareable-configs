# Getting Started

Documentation for personal use.

1. Update the root `package.json` with your repository name, url, and version.

2. Modify `packages/` to suit your needs.

3. Generate a `publish` access token from `NPM` and save as a secret titled `NPM_TOKEN` in your repository.

4. Run `yarn commit` to prompt for conventional changelog standard and commit changes.

5. For publishing a package to `NPM`, [see this guide for more information](https://github.com/waldronmatt/shareable-configs/blob/main/docs/PUBLISHING.md).
